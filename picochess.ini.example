### ===================================

### Example and description how to configure PicoChess
### To use this file, simply copy this file to picochess.ini and edit the appropriate settings
### When you want to activate a flag/line, please remove the "#" in front of it, e.g. "#book = ..." becomes "book = ..."
### It's important you keep this file valid (like here, no leading spaces), otherwise picochess won't work correctly.

### From v0.71 on some picochess.ini values are overridden when you change their values using the menu system
### Perhaps its a good idea to keep a copy of "picochess.ini" before you are going live with your picochess ;-)
### The section "DGT", "remote-engine", "Mail", and some "Picochess" flags are examples which can only be changed here

### Lines that start with 3x# are general comments
### Lines that start with 2x# explain the option of the next line that starts with one # 
### Lines that start with 1x# are option lines, delete the # to use the option

### = DGT related options =
### =======================

## To turn OFF the LEDs on the Revelation II board uncomment the next line
#disable-revelation-leds = True

## beep-config enables or disables the internal DGTPi beeper sounds or allows sound samples to be used instead. The options
## are "Never", "Sometimes", "Always" or "Sample". "Never" disables all beeps. "Always" enables all beeps. "Sometimes" enables
## beeps depending on the level set by the beep-some-level setting below. "Sample" is used to select audio samples for specific
## actions and requires correctly named sound samples (in ogg format) to be installed in the talker/voices/en/beeper folder.
## These samples can be used with or without a DGTPi/DGT3000 but only support two settings of beep-some-level.
#beep-config = ('none', 'some', 'all', or 'sample')
beep-config = none

## When beep-config is set to 'some', beep-some-level changes the frequency of occurrence of beeps. Minimum value is 0 (no beeps),
## maximum is 15 (all beeps). Please keep in mind: values 0 and 15 make no sense (but are allowed) since they are the same as 
## "Never" and "Always" inside the clock menu or via the beep-config option above ('none' or 'all' setting). 
## The value you give here, is when using the "Sometimes" menu selection (in System/Sound). Beeps are determined by a
## special number which you get by adding the following events together to get the beep-some-level value:
##
## CONFIG = 1 Takeback, GameEnd, NewGame, ComputerMove and SetPieces
## BUTTON = 2 All Events coming from button press
## MAP = 4    All Events coming from Queen placement from start position (rows 3-6) when used to select options
## OKAY = 8   All Events from "ok" (confirm) messages
## For example to beep on "ok messages" and "button press" events beep-some-level is: 8 (okay) + 2 (button) = 10
##
## When beep-config is set to 'sample' only values 0 (samples off), 1 (move confirmation), and 2 (move + button confirmation)
## will be considered.
#beep-some-level = 10
beep-some-level = 2

## Specify the serial port your DGT board is connected to.
## If you don't give a parameter picochess tries to find the board automatically (preferred usage).
#dgt-port = /dev/ttyACM0
## Instead of connecting to a DGT board, you can also start picochess with a command line.
## If so, please uncomment the next line
#enable-console = True

### Handle the next option with care! Only activate it if using a DGTPi or Raspberry Pi wired to a DGT 3000 clock. If you activate it
### but have non-DGT hardware connected to the GPIO pins of your Raspberry Pi, you might harm your hardware. A stock Raspberry Pi
### will not be harmed, but you will need to leave it commented out to use PicoChess.
## If you are using a DGTPi or Raspberry Pi wired to a DGT 3000 clock uncomment the next line.
#dgtpi = True
dgtpi = False

### You can reduce the DGT board piece recognition by a factor from 0 to 9. Please only use this if you suffer from
### sliding problems (like multi voices during you slide your pieces for example moving Bf1-b5 hear Be2,d3,c4 then b5).
#slow-slide = 5

### Options for sending the finished game via email service
### PicoChess currently implements two different ways to send a finished game via email:
### standard SMTP email or Mailgun Web service
### Mail general
### If email is not set, PicoChess won't attempt to send the game at all
## email tells PicoChess to which email address the game should be send to, it should be your email address :-)

### =======================================
### = Section for email delivery via SMTP =
### =======================================

### If smtp_server is not set, PicoChess won't attempt to send the game via SMTP
## smtp-server must contain the address of your smtp server (e.g. smtp.gmail.com)
#smtp-server = smtp.your-mailserver.com

## smtp-user is necessary if your smtp server requires authentication, sets your username
#smtp-user = your_username

## smtp-pass is necessary if your smtp server requires authentication, sets your password
## Note: some email services require a pre-generated app password rather than your email password.
#smtp-pass = your_secret_password

## Should PicoChess SSL-encrypt the communication with your smtp server (Port 465)?
## Otherwise PicoChess will use the default and unencrypted SMTP Port 21.
## Some SMTP Server require an SSL encryption (e.g. GMail). If so, uncomment the next line.
#smtp-encryption = True

## In case the SMTP Server thinks you are spamming, you must enter a valid from email here
#smtp-from = no-reply@picochess.org

### ==================
### = Time selection =
### ==================

## Sets the startup game time. If you give something like "5 0" that means 5 mins blitz with no increment
## (default value). Fischer time can be set by changing this "0" (increment value in secs) to a positive number
## like "3 2". Fixed time/move can be set by just giving one number like "10" meaning 10 secs/move. You can also give
## non-standard values (like "4 6"), but then you cannot change them inside the (time) menu.
## e.g., time = m or time = g i
## Examples:
##    time = 7   (time per move, e.g. m = 7 seconds)
##    time = 5 0 (game time, e.g. Blitz g = 5 min. and 0 sec. increment)
##    time = 5 3 (game time g = 5 min. plus i = 3 sec. increment)
##
## New for v3: Tournament time control settings!
## Tournament time control settings: n moves in g1 minutes (plus i sec. increment) and rest of the game in g2 minutes.
## e.g., time = n g i or time = n g1 i g2
## Examples:
##    time = 40 5 0 (n = 40 moves in g = 5 minutes with 0 sec. increment)
##    time = 40 5 3 (n = 40 moves in g = 5 minutes with i = 3 sec. Fischer inc.)
##    time = 40 60 0 30 (n = 40 moves in g1 = 90 minutes, i = 0 sec. increment and rest of the game in g2 = 30 minutes)
#time = 15 10
time = 15 10

## default time control setting when leaving a MAME emulated engine or the PGN engine and choosing a non MAME and
## non PGN engine
#def-timectrl = 15 10
def-timectrl = 15 10

## depth = max. number of search plies per move for the engine (if you want to restrict the engine move search to a max. number of plies
## in the search tree, set a depth > 0). In this case time control settings are ignored and move time is set to 999.
## default is depth = 0 (OFF). Range is 0 - 99.
#depth = 0
depth = 0

## node = max. number of search nodes per move for the engine (if you want to restrict the engine move search to a max number of nodes
## in the search tree, set a node > 0). In this case time control settings are ignored and move time is set to 999.
## default is node = 0 (OFF). Range is 0 - 99.
#node = 0
node = 0

## Online decrement: In order to better "sync" picochess times with online server times you can subtract X seconds after
## each own move from your remaining game time, default is 2s (try between 2 and 5s if out of sync with server times)
#online-decrement = 2

#tutor-watcher = True
tutor-watcher = True

## Pico Coach: move and position evaluation, move suggestion, etc. on demand. You can set it to 'on', 'off' or 'lift'.
## Default is 'off'. When set to 'on', you must trigger the evaluation via the PicoTutor menu. When set to 'lift‘, you can
## trigger the evaluation by lifting a king when it is your turn, waiting for the 'set pieces' prompt, and replacing the king on its
## original square. Additionally, you can trigger the coach via the PicoTutor menu. This is done by selecting the Pico Coach option
## to 'on' or 'lift' again.
#tutor-coach = lift

## Only use with a Raspberry Pi 4B hardware or better. Leave it blank for the original speed.
#rspeed = 1.0
rspeed = 1.0

## Retro-Sound Setting for MAME engines: default sound is off, if you want to switch it on, set rsound = True by
## uncommenting the next line
#rsound = True
rsound = True

# Player rating deviation for automatic adjustment of Elo, starting value: 350
#rating-deviation = 350
